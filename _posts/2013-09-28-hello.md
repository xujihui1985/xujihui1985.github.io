## Overview

### New Keyword in Generic


	public interface IReadOnlyRepository<out T>
	
	public interface IWriteOnlyRepository<in T>



### What's the meaning?

First of all, Covariance and Contravariance can only be used in Interface or Delegate
In my point of view, the keyword `out` means the Generic Type can only be used as return value, it can not be used as parameter,we can use Derived class to replace the Generic Type.

and the keyword `in` means the Generic Type can only be used as parameter and can not be used as return value, we can use Base class to replace the Generic Type

### Still, What's that mean?
image we have three class

	public class Person {}
	
	public class Employee : Person {}
	
	public class Manager : Employee {}


now we have a generic repository

	public interface IRepository<T>  {}
	
	public void Dump(IRepository<Person> repository)
	{
	    // do sth
	}


what if I want to Dump both `Employee` and `Manager`?

we can use Covairance to help this out


	public interface IReadOnlyRepository<out T>
	{
	    T FindById(int id);
	}
