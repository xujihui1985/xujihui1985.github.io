Apache Tomcat Not Showing in Eclipse Server Runtime Environments

If you did not install the package Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers so you have to make sure that you install the plug-in "JST Server Adapters Extensions".

To do so, go to Help->Install New Software... and select the "Kepler" repository. Then expand "Web, XML, Java EE and OSGi Enterprise Development" and check the box for "JST Server Adapters Extensions". Click "Finish", accept, install and restart. Now you should be able to add the new server like you're used to.
