the C# source code was compiled into IL by C# compiler, and at runtime, the JIT compiler will compile the IL into Native code, the JIT compiler compiles the code on a method-by-method basis, if the method has been JITed, it will not be JITed again.

JIT compilation can hurt startup times. so here comes `NGen`.

NGen can precompile IL to native code, that can be done before run time

Microsoft is now working on a replacement JIT called RyuJIT


#### Inlining

JIT compiler will replace method call with method body in the call site, for example

```
int add(int x, int y) {
  return x + y;
}

int z = add(4,5);

will be optimized to 

int z = 4 + 5
```

this will get rid of method call overhead

#### when JIT will inline a method

1. Don't contain exception handling (try...catch)
2. Are not virtual
3. Are not recursive

```
[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)] tells JIT never inline this method
void Method1()
[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)] tells JIT always inline this method when possible
void Method2()
```
