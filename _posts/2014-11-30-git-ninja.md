git rebase -i HEAD~4,  rebase the last 4 commit, you can edit, squash, pick ....

1. when we want to split one commit into two commit before push to remote.

```
edit the commit, and save

git reset --soft HEAD^

this give you the opptunity to recommit the file, you can use this command to split the commit
```

2. when we want to merge two commit into one

```
git rebase -i HEAD~4

reword the first commit then fixup the commit you want to merge into then save

```

git reset --soft and git reset --hard

--soft will reset the commit to index, you still have the changes you did

--hard will reset the commit to workspace, you lost the changes, you can use `git reflog` to restore the change

```
use git reflog to find the commit hash

and use git reset --hard hash to restore to that point

```

HEAD^ === HEAD~  means the parent of this commit

HEAD^2 means the second parent of this commit


`git blame` is useful when you want to see the detail of the file

`git cherry-pick` can be used when you just want one commit of three, you can cherry pick one of it

`git stash save --keep-index`
`git stash save --include-untracked`
