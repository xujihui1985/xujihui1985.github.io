### install docker on centos machine


- install
yum install -y docker

- check docker status
systemctl status docker.service

- systemctl start docker.service

min kernel version: 3.10.0

basic commands

docker -v

docker version

docker info



### update docker on ubuntu

1. add gpg key

```
wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/gpg | apt-key add -
```

2. add docker repository to sources.list

```
echo deb http://get.docker.com/ubuntu docker main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
```

3. apt-get update   
4. apt-get install lxc-docker

### run docker without roots

add users to Docker group
to create namespace, cgroups and binds to /var/run/docker.sock

```
sudo gpasswd -a sean docker

cat /etc/group
```


### config docker to communicate on network

docker default listen on a local unix socket, to config to run on tcp, we need: 

1. check netstat
```
netstat -tlp
```

2. stop docker 
```
service docker stop
```

3. run docker with -H command
```
docker -H 192.168.58.32:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock -d &
```

4. let docker client to talk to docker server via tcp
```
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.58.32:2375"
```


### some basic concept

image we are working in a large shipping company

### Docker Engine 

which is also called Docker demo is the Shipping Yard

### Docker Images

is the manifests of the goods which to ship

### docker containers

is the shipping containers

they all play good in there role

### Where images are stored

on ubuntu it's stored in /var/lib/docker/aufs/diff/xxxxxxxxx/

### copy images to other hosts

1. create a new image base on the current image

```
docker commit <image-hash> new-image-name
```

2. save the image to tar file

```
docker save -o /tmp/imagename.tar  imagename

peek inside to tar ball

tar -tf /tmp/imagename.tar

docker load -i /tmp/imagename.tar
```

3. commands for working with container

```
docker run --cpu-shares=256

docker run memory=1g

ctrl + p + q detaching from container
```

4. use nsenter to access to a running container
```
use docker inspect to get the pid of a running container
docker inspect <container> | grep Pid
nsenter -m -u -n -p -i -t <pid> /bin/bash
```

5. get ternimal inside a container

```
docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash
```

6. use docker to install software

```
docker run -v /usr/local/bin:/target  jpetazzo/nsenter

Installing nscenter to /target
Installing docker-enter to /target
```
use -v option to mount local directory to container, thus when container start, it will copy the file from container target directory to the local directory

### build with Dockerfile

```
docker build -t hello .
```

docker will take current diretory as build context, that is said all the file in the current directory can be used to build the image

### use private registry

```
docker tag <image-id> <dns-server of docker registry>:<port>/<image-name>
docker push <dns-server of docker registry>:<port>/<image-name>

eg:

docker tag 43df3123 registry.docker.com:5000/private-test
docker push registry.docker.com:5000/private-test
```

**note**

add `DOCKER_OPTS="--insecure-registry registry.docker.com:5000"` into docker config file at /etc/default/docker

for redhat system that use systemd

```
edit the systemd unit file for the docker service

/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service

ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker -d $OPTIONS $DOCKER_STORAGE_OPTIONS --insecure-registry registry.docker.com:5000
```


### reduce the number of Layers in images

each instruction will become a new layer, that add lots of unnessary layer, we can reduce the number of layers

```
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
	    apache2 \
		apache2-utils \
        vim \
		&& apt-get clean \
		&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["apache2ctl", "-D", "FIREGROUND"]
```

### Dockerfile Instruction

#### CMD

only executes at runtime when lanuch the container

there can only be one CMD instruction per Dockerfile, and the cmd specified in `docker run ... <command>` will override the cmd instruction in Dockerfile

```
CMD echo "Hello world"

CMD ["echo", "hello world"]
``` 

#### ENTRYPOINT

can't be overridden at run-time with normal commands
docker run ... <command>

any command at run-time is used as an argument to ENTRYPOINT

```

ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]

docker run image Helloworld   //helloworld will be treated as argument

so using ENTRYPOINT like this are containers behave like a binary

```

when use CMD with ENTRYPOINT, things get interesting, as CMD can be override by the commandline, so we can use CMD as the default arguments of ENTRYPOINT

```
CMD ["hello world"]
ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]

docker run -it helloworld    //hello world
docker run -it hey there    //hey there
```

### ENV

used to set the enviroment variable in the container
```
ENV var1=ping var2=8.8.8.8

CMD $var1 $var2
```

### Volumns

```
docker run -it -v /data --name=volumecontainer ubuntu
```

after the volumecontainer started, we can access the volume from another container by `--volumnes-from=volumecontainer`

```
docker run -it --volumes-from=volumecontainer ubuntu /bin/bash
```

we can also mount the directory from our host machine to the container

```
docker run -v /data:/data  //that will mount the /data directory from our local host to the /data in the container
```

VOLUMN instruction

```
VOLUME /data
```

if we want to remove the container with volume, we need to specify the -v option `docker rm -v` otherwise the volume will not be deleted


### docker networking

docker0 bridge

inspect the network interface by `ip a`

there is an interface called `docker0`, when the docker daemon starts on our docker host, it creates this docker0 interface, it's actually a bit more than just an interface, it actually a bridge creatd entirely in software inside the linux kernel, and docker0 is crucial to container networking, it passes or switches packets between two connected devices.

we can use `bridge-utils` package to see the details of the docker0 interface

```
brctl show docker0
```

docker inspect <container>    see NetworkSettings

when look inside the container file /var/lib/docker/containers/<hash>/, you can see hosts resolv.conf

```
docker run --dns=8.8.4.4
```
this will use 8.8.4.4 as dns in the new container

if the network docker assign has confilcate with the current network that is said the range of the address has been used.

```
ip link del docker0    delete the docker0 link
```

edit the docker config file

```
vim /etc/default/docker

DOCKER_OPTS=--bip=150.150.0.1/24
```

--icc is short for inter-container communication, default to true, turning off this option will stop the container to communicate with each other.
--iptables indicate if is allowed to modify iptable

be aware of this, if you found your container is not able to talk each other, chech these two option

#### private network ranges

10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0      10.0.0.0/8 // from 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0/255.240.0.0  172.16.0.0/15 // from 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 
192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0 192.168.0.0/16 // from 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255


### EXPOSE

EXPOSE 80  //expose 80 port to hostmachine


### logging

docker -d -l debug &  //start docker daemon with log level debug

/etc/default/docker

DOCKER_OPTS="--log-level=fatal"
